# Email application

## Mail Application with Tkinter and smtplib

## Description


This Python application provides a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for sending emails using the Tkinter library for the frontend and the smtplib library for handling email operations. The application allows users to input their email credentials, recipient's email address, email subject, and the email body. It also includes functionality for resetting the input fields and sending emails.


## Features

User-friendly GUI for email input and sending.  
Input validation to ensure all required fields are filled.  
Sends emails using the SMTP protocol.  
Password entry is masked for security.  


## How to Use

Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open the terminal or command prompt in the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using the following command:

bash

python mail_application.py

The GUI window will appear, allowing you to input your email details.

Fill in the required fields: Email, Password, To (recipient's email), Subject, and Body.

Click the "Send" button to send the email. If any fields are empty, an error message will be displayed.

To reset the input fields, click the "Reset" button.

## Note

This application uses the Gmail SMTP server by default. If you are using a different email provider, you may need to modify the SMTP server and port in the code accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

    If you encounter any issues sending emails, ensure that your email provider allows less secure apps, or use an app-specific password.

## Disclaimer

This application is a basic example and may not cover all edge cases or security considerations. Use it responsibly and adapt it to your specific needs.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to enhance functionality or customize the application according to your preferences.

Enjoy using the Mail Application!
